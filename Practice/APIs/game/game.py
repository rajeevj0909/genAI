Welcome to the Role-Playing Guessing Game!

In this game:
1. The AI chooses a secret role and goal.
2. Your task is to uncover the AI's role or prevent it from achieving its goal.
3. The AI will respond to your messages, dropping subtle clues about its role and goal.
4. If you guess the role and goal, you win! If you give up, the AI wins.

Type 'quit' or 'exit' at any time to end the game.
