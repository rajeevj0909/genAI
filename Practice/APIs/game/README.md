## **Gameplay:**

1. **AI Role and Goal Selection:**  
   The AI chooses a unique character role and goal, which it must accomplish while keeping its true identity a secret.
   
2. **Interaction:**  
   You interact with the AI by typing messages. The AI responds as the character it has chosen, attempting to achieve its goal.

3. **Identity and Goal Concealment:**  
   The AI will try to achieve its goal without revealing its true identity. If you discover the AI’s true identity or if the AI fails its goal, the game ends.
