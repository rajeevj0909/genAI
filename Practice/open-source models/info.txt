I installed Ollama as it's easy to use
I then ran: ollama run gemma2:2b

This downloaded the 1.6gb model in around 15 mins
Then I could talk to the model

Use /help or /? for help

The "/set system Answer like a pirate" sets a system message

I can also save and clear history.
Save history allows me to remember what the previous messages are for.
Clearing means that it doesnt need to load everything said before it, speeding up processing time and reducing hallucination.

To run everytime, I can just run this: ollama run gemma2:2b
This will not download the files again and I can just use the already downloaded files.
